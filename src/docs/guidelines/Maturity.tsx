        <p>
          Maturity is a percentage for a Feature or a project, worked out from its
          Capabilities&rsquo; stability levels. What it means, how it&rsquo;s counted, and why 100%
          isn&rsquo;t the goal are in the readme&rsquo;s{" "}
          <ReadmeLink path={MATURITY}>Maturity</ReadmeLink> page. This page covers how to show it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>It&rsquo;s for Exalynt&rsquo;s own tools.</strong> The portal uses it so clients
          can follow progress on their projects and Features. Client products don&rsquo;t show it to
          their users; they show stability.

          A ring takes the color of the{" "}
          <ReadmeLink path={`${MATURITY}#reading-a-maturity`}>band</ReadmeLink> it&rsquo;s in, named
          for the level at its top. The band&rsquo;s name, from <code>MATURITY_BANDS</code>, is what
          screen readers hear and what the popover says, so don&rsquo;t name bands in copy of your
          own.
        </p>
      </Guidance>

      <Guidance title="Always the ring, always the percentage">
        <p>
          Maturity is only ever drawn as <code>MaturityRing</code>, for a Feature and a project
          alike, and in its own popover, and it always shows its percentage. A bar or a row of boxes
          would look like the stability mark&rsquo;s Track, and the two must never be confused.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>A project:</strong> at 52px, labelled (<code>labelled</code> and{" "}
            <code>count</code>), at the top right of its page; unlabelled on each project&rsquo;s
            card, with <code>focusable={"{false}"}</code> since the card is the link.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A Feature:</strong> at 24px, with the percentage beside it, on its card in a
            backlog and in lists of Features. Pass <code>subject=&quot;feature&quot;</code> and the
            Feature&rsquo;s name as <code>label</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              <code>MaturityDetails</code>, on a page:
            </strong>{" "}
            the popover&rsquo;s content with <code>card={"{false}"}</code>, where maturity is
            explained in a card of your own.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Guidance>

      <Guidance title="The popover">
        <p>
          Every ring opens a popover that tells the client how mature this is: the ring again with
          its band, one sentence on what that band means, a short muted definition of maturity, and
          a link to the readme. Keep it to that. Whether a maturity is healthy, and{" "}
          <ReadmeLink path={`${MATURITY}#why-100-isnt-the-goal`}>
            why 100% isn&rsquo;t the goal

          , are the readme&rsquo;s to explain.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Show what it&rsquo;s made of</strong> wherever you have it: pass{" "}
            <code>count</code>, and a <code>breakdown</code> listing each Capability with its
            stability mark, or each Feature with a 20px ring, most mature first and drafts last.
            Give the marks and rings in a breakdown <code>link={"{false}"}</code> and{" "}
            <code>focusable={"{false}"}</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>It opens on hover, keyboard focus, and tap,</strong> like the stability popover,
            and needs no separate info button.
